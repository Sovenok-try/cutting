## cutting

This code was created to cutting images to smaller one. 

In the script "Cutting.py" you need to write name of initial image, path to it and path to the folder, where you want cutted pieces to be.\
If the folder doesn't exist, this script will create folder named "name of image_cut"\
This script works with images with different count of channels.
